# ðŸ“ŠðŸ«€ Heart Attack Prediction

This Python project provides an efficient and clean solution to analyze datasets stored in CSV format using the `pandas` library. It is ideal for quick insights, data quality checks, and basic exploration tasks.

---

## ðŸ§ª Script Features

The script performs foundational exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, including:

- **Data Loading**: Reads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Preview**: Displays the first few rows using `head()`.
- **Structure Overview**: Shows data types and memory usage via `info()`.
- **Missing Values Check**: Identifies columns with null entries.
- **Statistical Summary**: Uses `describe()` for numerical insights.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Requirements

This project requires:

- Python 3.x
- pandas

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure `data.csv` is in the same directory as `main.py`.

To execute the analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

The script will print:

- Dataset information (column names, data types, and memory usage)
- A preview of the first few rows
- A summary of missing values per column
- Descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, standard deviation, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Future Work

- Data visualization using matplotlib/seaborn
- Advanced analysis (e.g., correlation heatmap, outlier detection)
- CLI argument support for input file flexibility
